In the React module, you built a client for the Noteful application (this checkpoint contains the wireframes and details in the Assignment Section as a reminder). Now it's time to revisit that app and bring together all of the skills you've been working on in this module. Design and build a Noteful database with tables to represent folders and notes. Demonstrate how these two tables are related.


#### Perform database design and normalization for the Noteful app.

#### Write SQL migration scripts to create Noteful database with tables for folders and notes including relationships and CASCADES

#### Write Note and Folder service objects for the new tables designed above.

#### Write routers to perform CRUD operations for Notes and Folders.

#### Write an Express server for the Noteful API with the endpoints /notes and /folders.

#### Refactor the client application to use this API. Start by changing the URL used to request data and see if that works. If not, make necessary modifications to the [client application.](https://github.com/ChandaHubbard/Noteful-React-Client)
